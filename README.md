# Project 2

This data analysis of the ecommerce dataset will analyze two domains: products and users.

The first domain, products, will show a variety of different groupings related to the products, including the total number of orders for each item, the amount of times each product was either added to a users cart and purchased, the total number of orders associated with each product, the amount of times a specific user purchased a specific product, and finally a list of 20% of products to cut based off the highest difference between the amount of times each product was added to a cart and purchased. The higher the difference implies that those products were added to carts but not purchased.

The second domain, users, will show a variety of different groupings related to users, including a list of each user and the amount of times they added an item to their carts, the amount of times they purchased aforementioned items, and the difference between the amount of items thaey added to a cart and the amount of times purchased. Additionally, it will show each user and the amount of orders they have had, and the amount of times a specific user purchased a specific product.
